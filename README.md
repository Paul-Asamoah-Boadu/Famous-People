<h2>Introduction</h2>

This project is a simple demonstration of how to create, manipulate and query a PostgreSQL database using SQL. The database contains 3 tables; `persons`, `hobbies` and `friends` and a second database with 2 tables; `customers` and `orders`.

This project sought to test the understanding of all the JOINS available in SQL as well as altering and updating a table. 
The JOINS used in this project include:

- `self join`
- `implicit join`
- `explicit join`
- `cross join`
- `left outer join`
- `inner join`
- `full join`
